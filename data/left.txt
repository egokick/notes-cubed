I sent the updated datadog-report to tekla, I believe it isn't actually using the last deployment date in the production environment, but the last "Event" date, whatever that means. At least it is a record that something happened in their production environment 

* Vicente sent me a monitor that is being reported on but it is in the wrong status in the report - check the workflow and correct it


 existence of the service column
 remove the pivot value and the pivot_key from the datadog report
 * in the datadog report include in the data pulled from discovery the artifact environment and the date of the last deployment


explain to olga these are all artifacts - 
tekla suggested to present only 

		* we already have the report for all aws services, but olga asked us to speak to observability team to see if theres a quicker way to query the data than to use discovery*
