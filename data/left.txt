* Vicente sent me a monitor that is being reported on but it is in the wrong status in the report - check the workflow and correct it

* olga wants a report for all apm servicesww
additional column that says yes/no for apm, based on the existence of the service column
 remove the pivot value and the pivot_key from the datadog report
 * in the datadog report include in the data pulled from discovery the artifact environment and the date of the last deployment


explain to olga these are all artifacts - 
tekla suggested to present only 

		* we already have the report for all aws services, but olga asked us to speak to observability team to see if theres a quicker way to query the data than to use discovery*
